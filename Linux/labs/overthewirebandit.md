# ðŸ§ª OverTheWire Bandit Walkthrough (Levels 0-20)

This document covers my walkthrough of the OverTheWire Bandit wargame from Level 0 to Level 20.

## ðŸŽ® What is Bandit?

[Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is a Linux-based wargame designed to teach and test command-line skills. Each level requires using shell commands to uncover a password hidden in the file system. The goal is to retrieve the password for the next level by solving practical, real-world style challenges.

This walkthrough includes all levels from 0 to 20, with the exact commands I used and brief insights into what I learned at each step.

## âœ¨ My Journey with OverTheWire Bandit

> As part of strengthening my Linux foundation, I explored the OverTheWire Bandit wargame â€” an incredibly effective and hands-on way to improve real-world command-line skills. The game presents challenges that gradually increase in complexity, each one reinforcing core Linux concepts through practical problem-solving.

For those new to it, Bandit is designed to boost your confidence in the terminal. Youâ€™re tasked with navigating file systems, decoding obscure files, working with permissions, and using essential shell commands to find hidden passwords and advance through levels. Itâ€™s not just a learning experience â€” itâ€™s a puzzle-based journey into the Linux CLI.
